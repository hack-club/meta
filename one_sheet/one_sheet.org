#+TITLE: Hack Club

Hack Club helps high schoolers start awesome after-school coding clubs. We
provide everything needed to get started: curriculum, leadership training,
community, and events.

In the US alone, 3 in 4 high schools don't offer any coding classes and we're
setting out to help students change that. We think coding is a superpower that
anyone can learn and we want to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity,
gender, or socioeconomic status, the opportunity.

Our mission is twofold:

1. To make bringing high-quality coding education to a high school as low-cost
   and frictionless as possible.
2. We're deeply concerned by computer science curriculum currently
   being taught in schools. Coding changed our lives because it showed us we can
   build anything, not because it showed us how to ace a test. Through our
   clubs, we want to introduce coding to today and tomorrow's high schoolers as
   the next art, not the next algebra.

* Our Impact
Since our conception in late 2014, we've grown to 84 schools in 16 states and 7
countries, reaching over 1,500 students.

In our latest poll, clubs reported 33% of members to be female (nearly 2x high
school coding class average) and 37% of members to be black or Hispanic (7x
industry average).
