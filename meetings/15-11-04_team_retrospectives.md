_Attendees_:

- Dave Fontenot
- Jonathan Leung
- Max Wofford
- Zach Latta

## Notes from Meeting

- The board order can be prioritized in whatever order.
  - Assuming everything in the meta issue can be finished in the week, the order
    of tasks (in the meta issue) is fine.
  - Issues can be pulled over from `new ideas`, `next week`, and `this week` as
    long as the tasks in the meta issue are completed by Monday.
  - Small pull requests can be added without corresponding issues.
  - Large pull requests should have issues.
- Use discretion when changing meta issue.
  - When updating it, bring it up in github comments.
  - To change the order of issues in the meta issue, comment on the github issue
    to get approval from @zachlatta.
- Issues that take time over the course of the week should be put `in` progress
  under the meta issue.
- Ideas column should be under 25 issues.
