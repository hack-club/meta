# Sely's Notes
## Meeting with Mr. Smith
### 08/27/2015, 11:50am
Purpose was to ask about his interest in being an adviser for our club.

Dan said "Well, what do you want to know?" --> bad start, seems like an
unprepared pitch

Appealed to teacher's subject (APCS) and said that the club would help students
out with that, also a good mission

Did not ask "are you still interested in being involved" and jumped straight to
signatures after the pitch: "I'd ask you to sign but I don't have the paper..."
  -> unprepared?

He suggested another teacher who could help out with after school? Shows that
teachers may not necessarily want to be too committed if they have other things
outside of school.
