# Retrospectives

_Attendees:_

- Dave Fontenot

## Is there any hidden WIP that we haven’t gotten onto the board yet?

Not really, most of it seems to be covered.

## Can we identify any impediments to the flow of work?

- Meeting notes haven't been being submitted
- Dave going to Lowell

We had a fair amount of discussion about restructuring the flow of work to
improve this.

Actionables

- [ ] Everyone will update the "Next Week" board to only have tasks that they're
  planning on tackling next week.
- [ ] Combine "New Issues" and "Ideas" columns
- [ ] Rename "Todo" to "This Week"
- [ ] Add to planning session calendar events that by the end of the planning
  session, the Next Week column should be empty
- [ ] Update docs and communicate to Max that we work right to left on the
  board, starting with Review.

## Are we tracking things at the right level of granularity?

For now we are, we'll revisit in the future.

## Are there queues or buffers in your workflow that aren’t represented?

Ideas might build up, but we'll see. The bunch of changes we made earlier
