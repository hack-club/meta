# Event Protocol

This document contains our checklist that must be completed for all events run
directly by Hack Club.

## Preparation

- [ ] Link to our [code of conduct][code_of_conduct] in marketing materials.

[code_of_conduct]: https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/CONDUCT.md

## Day Of

- [ ] Place a sign on the entrance of the venue with the name of the event and
  the phone number of one of the organizers (in case people who arrive late need
  to get in or otherwise reach an organizer).
- [ ] Introduce the event and present the code of conduct to the attendees.
  Don't spend time going into details, instead paraphrase "The code of conduct"
  essentially says, respect other people and do not make them feel
  uncomfortable".
- [ ] Make it clear which organizer to talk to if an attendee is not satisfied,
  feeling uncomfortable or would like to provide feedback in general.
