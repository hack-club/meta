## Project Management

We use ZenHub with GitHub Issues to manage our team workflow.

Our board has the following columns:

- **New Issues** - Issues that have not been categorized into a column yet. This
  is the default location for new issues.
- **Ideas** - Issues that we're not actively working on as a team, but may
  decide to prioritize in the future.
- **Backlog** - Issues that we're actively planning on addressing, but aren't
  currently high priority.
- **To Do** - Issues that are in our immediate team queue.
- **In Progress** - Issues that are currently being worked on by a member of the
  team. When a team member begins working on an issue, they should drag it into
  _In Progress_.
- **Review** - The deliverable for the task has been submitted and is currently
  being reviewed by another member of the team. This is usually in the form of a
  pull request.

## Labs program

The Labs program will follow this format:

1. Workshops
   - These are based on the workshops from Hack Camp
   - Labs program workshops can be found in the
     (playbook)[https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops]
2. Case Studies
   - To collect data from each meeting without core hackEDU team members being
     there, each club meeting will have a case study
   - Each case study consists of 2 files:
     1. `planning.md`
     2. `recap.md` ex.
