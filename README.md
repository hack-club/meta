## About

[hackEDU](http://hackedu.us) helps high school students start and lead
programming clubs to create the next generation of hackers. 

A hacker is someone who creates things that they see missing in the world and
isn't afraid to break the rules.

We think the best way to make the world awesome is to create the next
generation of hackers because hackers are changemakers.

## Docs Outline

### Values and Mission

At hackEDU, we live and breath the mission.
[`values_and_mission.md`](values_and_mission.md) describes what we're all
about.

### Club Playbook

*[Incomplete]*

We are slowly building up a "Club Playbook" which is a playbook that helps you
get your club up and running and will contain best practices on how to run your
club. This is merely a mere place to start and is *by no means* the definitive
best way to do things. We expect you to continue Drawing The Owl and make
everything your own, forking it, and making it better.

## FAQ

##### Why do we need another learn to code organization?

The answer is that we don't. We're not a learn to code organization. We're
not building another Codecademy. We're leveraging existing curriculum and our
primary focus is building families and communities.

##### How do you scale?
