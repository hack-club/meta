No

**Please provide us with a short description of who you are and what inspired you to start your current venture. (100-200 words)**

I care deeply about privacy, open source, and social change enabled by the internet.

When I was 16, I tested out of high school and moved to San Francisco, where I joined Yo as their first engineer. While I was there, I led their engineering team during the large press cycle (NYT, TIME, WIRED, WSJ) and built out features for partnerships with the NBA and Motorola, among others. After Yo, I started Hack Club to help high schoolers start coding clubs around the globe. In the past year and a half we've grown to 84 schools in 16 states and 7 countries.

Learning to code changed my life because it showed me that I can build anything and be anyone – I truly think it's the closest thing we have to a superpower.

When I entered high school, I was disappointed to find that like 3 in 4 schools in the US, my school didn't offer any coding classes. I didn't want to give up there, so I started a coding club. We met weekly and something incredible happened: our members—who joined having no experience—started building apps, websites, and games. I would have never expected this from a regular computer science class.

After meeting other high schoolers who had also started clubs after running into the same problem, I resolved to start Hack Club to unite us and spread coding clubs worldwide.

Education

**Please provide a capsule description of your venture. Include any additional major programs or related initiatives. (75-125 words)**

Hack Club helps high schoolers start awesome after-school coding clubs. We provide everything needed to get started: curriculum, leadership training, community, and events.

Our clubs meet once or twice a week. If you walk into a typical meeting, you'll see 10 - 25 club members building art, games, websites, and more. Members are constantly collaborating and pushing each other to reach their potential.

**What is your plan to sustain as a venture? (100 words)**

We have a few ideas, but haven't finalized on any one particular plan yet. Right now we're focused on building a 10/10 experience for every Hack Club member.

- Since we're so geographically diverse and have the means to build software to keep very detailed data on clubs, we could build a robust process around applying for local grants and making compelling claims based on data.
- We could create a "Hack Club Fellowship" where club leaders and members apply to do a gap year with us in San Francisco. They could make up the bulk of our workforce and we could pay their salaries using sponsorships from local tech companies or other forms of contributions.
- Many tech companies have social responsibility programs that we're a very good fit for. This would be recurring money.
- We could package our curriculum to follow standards and license it to schools. We've had schools interested in licensing our content, but have turned them down so far.
- We could experiment with member dues, but we're pretty adamant about keeping everything free for our users.

**For-profit ventures, please explain your business plan, revenue goals and how you plan to reach your goals, including when you became (or plan to become profitable). For all other entities, please explain your plans to develop other funding streams outside of year-to-year philanthropic contributions. (200-300 words)**

For the foreseeable future while we continue to perfect our model, we plan to continue to focus on philanthropic contributions as our main revenue stream.

Long term, I've included a few ideas for what we could do above.

**Using a detailed case study, walk us through how your venture works, from the perspective of your end user. (150-200 words)**

Take Mariano, a Hack Club leader who just graduated.

Mariano grew up in East LA with three siblings and a single mother. To fill the time while growing up, he'd take things apart. He eventually disassembled the family's TV and that's when it clicked – technology was the path for him.

When he entered 9th grade at Theodore Roosevelt High School, he decided he wanted to learn to code. He didn't have a computer or internet access at home, so he'd go to the library after school and used online resources to teach himself. He decided that coding was his ticket out of his community and he pursued it relentlessly – eventually landing local businesses as website clients.

Roosevelt High School has a 20% dropout rate and no coding classes. Mariano wanted to change that and give his fellow students the opportunity to learn. After hearing about Hack Club at the local Boys & Girls Club, he went to our website and submitted an application. From there we:

1. Set up a phone interview and accepted him
2. Set up weekly calls and worked with him one-on-one to plan for the first meeting
3. They had their first meeting (22 students came) and we did a recap in a call. We continued to do weekly check-ins until he had a regular club membership, then we switched to online check-ins.

We provide our club leaders with:

- Pre-written workshops to run in club meetings
- Lots of resources on running a successful club (see https://guide.hackclub.com for an example)
- One-on-one help with staff

## Impact & Growth

**How do you measure your venture's impact? How has it grown over time? (300 words)**

Over the past year and a half, we've grown from essentially nothing to 84 schools in 16 states and 7 countries, reaching 1,500 students.

When we last polled, our club leaders reported that 33% of club members are female (nearly 2x what we see in high school coding classes) and 37% of members are black or Hispanic (7x industry average).

Our growth targets are as follows:

- End of 2016: 200 schools
- End of 2017: 500 schools
- End of 2018: 1250 schools
- End of 2020: 100,000 students in clubs

We're still very young and don't have great long-term impact data as a result. Many of our club leaders who graduated last year went to top-tier schools, but we don't have concrete data (so no stats on majors).

Improving our data collection using software is a priority for the 2016 - 2017 school year. Namely, we want to:

- Record every member's attendance statistics (this'll let us calculate things like MAU)
- Keep track of the code every club member publicly writes
- Keep track of where members go to college and what they major in

**Last year, how many people did your venture directly impact?**

850

**How many people is your venture projected to directly impact this year?**

3400

**Please explain these numbers in a few sentences.**

Based on our most recent poll, the average club size is 17 members. We ended 2015 with 50 clubs and are on track to expand to 200 clubs by the end of 2016.

**What are the obstacles to your continued growth? What are your venture's greatest pain points and needs? (200 words)**

We need to secure funds for and make two critical hires for the 2016 - 2017 school year: an operations manager and a full-time curriculum designer.

The operations manager will manage club logistics and onboarding as we grow. They'll work directly with me to build scalable processes that'll support our growth in the years to come.

The curriculum designer will own all of our club content – something that's been juggled by all members of the team so far. We want to bring on an expert that has extensive teaching experience that they can apply to turn our content into something that's truly cohesive.

**What has been your biggest failure or mistake so far? What did you learn from it? (200 words)**

## Innovation & Your Fellowship

**What makes your venture innovative? (100 words)**

Two big things:

1. We don't follow a direct service model
2. We're an open source project

We're not direct service:

Instead of teaching coding ourselves, we help high schoolers around the globe bring coding education to their local communities.

This dramatically reduces our costs and allows us to achieve geographic and socioeconomic diversity very quickly – all it takes is a single high school student who wants to start a club. This also means that we have no program costs, so every dollar invested is spent onboarding clubs and optimizing our content and processes.

We're an open source project:

Most of the others in our space think of their curriculum as their secret sauce and guard it accordingly (ex. https://girlswhocode.com/ and https://www.makeschool.com/).

We take the opposite approach and think we'll be able to build higher quality content—and therefore better club—by taking Wikipedia's approach: making it free and editable by anyone. We're already seeing club leaders and members improving our content, but we eventually want to get to the point where we're a canonical source of learn-to-code-content.

**How does your venture distinguish itself within the field in which you are working? What are you doing that is totally unique? What are you the first, best or only at? (400 words)**

Bringing high-quality coding education to schools is time-intensive and expensive. By going through students instead of the administration, Hack Club bypasses most of the red tape and costs associated with starting a new program at a school.

Starting a Hack Club can take as little as two weeks. Our student leaders don't need to find their own space (the school is their space), recruit external volunteers (their friends are volunteers), or hire teachers (they teach using our pre-written workshops). This model makes the cost of starting a new club virtually $0 from our end and we think it'll let us scale where others haven't.

Compared to CodeNow (https://www.codenow.org/):

CodeNow helps companies run workshops for local high school students. Starting a CodeNow event takes securing a host company, recruiting high schoolers from local schools, and securing mentors. We talked with a former employee at the company who said that organizing a single event can take over 4 months (recruiting local high schoolers was particularly difficult because it required going through the administration).

Compared to Codecademy/other online tools (https://www.codecademy.com/):

We view your coding ability as simply a function of time: if you spend more time coding, you'll be a better coder. Simple as that.

Codecademy is a fantastic tool that makes getting started online very easy, but there's no solid accountability mechanism when getting started. If you get stuck and don't force yourself to come back to Codecademy, chances are you'll stop coding.

Students typically join Hack Clubs with their friends. Once you come to a meeting, there's a social pressure to keep coming back and keep coding because that's what your friends are doing. We think this sort of peer support is critically important as a beginner and is very difficult to pull off when you're not in-person.

**How did you hear about the Fellowship?**

direct email solicitation

**What would you hope to get out of your participation in the Fellowship? (100-200 words)**

Chicago is one of our target markets for clubs. As we start to grow our club presence there, we want to increase our reputation in Chicago and get plugged into its social impact community – the BHSI Fellowship sounds like a tremendous opportunity to do this.

More specifically, we'd hope to get any of the following:

- Connections to Chicago-based educators (ideally those who have introduced technology to a Chicago school)
- More Chicago-based legitimacy/backing – will help our validity when growing our presence
- Connections to Chicago-based talent – in the case that we go all-in for our reach in Chicago, we'd want someone on the ground
- Connections to world class leaders across industries

For me personally, I'd hope to get:

- A broader and more diverse view of what late-stage social impact nonprofits look like – the Chicago Ideas Week sounds like a particularly good forum for this.
- Connections to peers that are also working on social impact initiatives. It gets lonely out here in the Bay Area where it feels like everyone's playing the VC game!

**Who are you hoping to connect with via the Fellowship?**

Copied and pasted from above:

- Chicago-based educators (ideally those who have introduced technology to a Chicago school)
- Chicago-based talent – in the case that we go all-in for our reach in Chicago, we'd want someone on the ground
- World class leaders across industries

## Optional Questions

**Do you have a connection to the Midwest? If so, please explain.**

The Reva and David Logan Foundation, our primary funder, is based in Chicago. We also have 5 clubs in the Chicago suburbs.

**Additional Comments:**

I should mention that I truly appreciate Julia reaching out to me about this opportunity.
