  \opening{Dear Richard,}

  When we began working on this proposal, we started by reading every grant
  proposal we've written.

  My god, was it a painful process.

  It's humbling to see how Hack Club has grown from a nascent idea into
  something that students have started to really care about. And it's hard to
  not be optimistic for the future.

  In short, we more than tripled in size and saw bets that we made when we first
  started pay off. We made infrastructure investments that paid off. We saw
  clubs break out of their schools and host events for hundreds of students. We
  saw over half a million messages get sent in our community.

  If Hack Club was a child, 2016 was the year it learned to walk. 2017 is
  shaping up to be the year it learns to jog.
