  \opening{Dear Richard,}

  When we started this proposal, the first thing we did was read every grant
  proposal we've written.

  That was a physically painful process and I almost feel guilty for subjecting
  other human beings to that. Even you.

  This past year and a half has been very special for Hack Club.

  If Hack Club was a toddler, 2016 was the year it learned to walk.

  We more than tripled in size. Our clubs threw events for hundreds of students.
  We broke Google Sheets and had to write our own software to manage clubs. We
  started seeing students bake Hack Club into their identity. Athul started a
  club in Kerala and has never had a meeting with less then 100 members.

  I think 2017 will be the year Hack Club learns to jog.

  When we started, The Reva \& David Logan Foundation was the first to
  take a bet on us. As we transition to this next stage, I hope that the
  foundation can again be the first to take a bet and invest in our mission.

  If I'm being completely honest, Hack Club pre-2016 feels like a completely
  different organization than Hack Club today. In the enclosed proposal, I've
  outlined our progress, short-term goals, and vision for the future.

  I hope the time spent on this shows through, but I imagine I'll look back on
  this in two years and be equally pained.
