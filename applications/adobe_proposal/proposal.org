#+TITLE: Hack Club Proposal

Hack Club helps high schoolers start awesome after-school coding clubs. We
provide everything needed to get started: curriculum, leadership training,
community, and events.

In the US alone, 3 in 4 high schools don't offer any coding classes and we're
setting out to help students change that. We think coding is a superpower that
anyone can learn and we want to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity,
gender, or socioeconomic status, the opportunity.

Our mission is twofold:

1. To make bringing high-quality coding education to a high school as low-cost
   and frictionless as possible.
2. We're deeply concerned by computer science curriculum currently
   being taught in schools. Coding changed our lives because it showed us we can
   build anything, not because it showed us how to ace a test. Through our
   clubs, we want to introduce coding to today and tomorrow's high schoolers as
   the next art, not the next algebra.

* Our Impact
Since our conception in late 2014, we've grown to 84 schools in 16 states and 7
countries, reaching over 1,500 students.

In our latest poll, clubs reported 33% of members to be female (nearly 2x high
school coding class average) and 37% of members to be black or Hispanic (7x
industry average).

* How it Works
Hack Clubs are student-led coding clubs. They typically meet once or twice a
week after-school and draw between 10 - 25 members each meeting.

There are three ingredients needed to start a Hack Club:

- Student leader
- Host teacher
- Hack Club's resources

Students apply to start a Hack Club through our website. After going through our
review process, we set up weekly calls and work with them one-on-one to get the
club started.

We provide pre-written workshops for each club meeting. Each workshop walks club
members through the process of building real things using real tools -- there's
no sandbox or magic involved. By the end of the first meeting, every member has
their first website online and hosted on GitHub. By the end of the third,
everyone has generated artwork using code. By the end of the fifth, every member
has built a game similar to Super Mario Bros -- and so on.

If you walk into a Hack Club, you'll see an atmosphere similar to a hackathon.
Club members work independently on workshops/projects and they're constantly
collaborating and helping each other. Clubs periodically host demo days, where
members show off what they build.

** Why Hack Club
Bringing high-quality coding education to schools is time-intensive and
expensive. By going through students instead of the administration, Hack
Club bypasses most of the red tape and costs associated with starting a new
program at a school.

Starting a Hack Club can take as little as two weeks. Our student leaders don't
need to find their own space (the school is their space), recruit external
volunteers (their friends are volunteers), or hire teachers (they teach using
our pre-written workshops). This model makes the cost of starting a new club
virtually $0 from our end and we think it'll let us scale where others haven't.

* Goals
- 2016 :: Bring Hack Clubs to 200 schools
- 2017 :: Bring Hack Clubs to 500 schools
- 2020 :: Impact 100,000 students annually through our clubs

* The Ask
We need Adobe's help scaling our operations to hit 200 schools by the end
of 2016. The hires made and processes built over the next 6 months will lay the
groundwork for all future Hack Club growth -- we expect this to bring us through
the "ramping up" phase of the hockey stick and into exponential growth.

We're requesting $140,000 in support to make this happen. $100,000 will go to
hiring our first operations manager and the remaining $40,000 will go to
establishing a discretionary operations budget.

The operations manager will manage club logistics and onboarding as we grow.
They'll work directly with our executive director, Zach Latta, to build scalable
processes that'll support us in the years to come. They'll be compensated
$80,000 -- the remaining $20,000 will cover taxes and benefits.

The discretionary budget will fund additional operational expenses through
2016 - 2017 school year. Because of the pure volume and diversity of schools
we'll be in, we expect to regularly travel onsite -- especially in the case of
low-income and underfunded school districts. We also expect to experiment with
new onboarding methods, included shipping physical materials to club leaders.

** Adobe's Impact
With Adobe's support, we'll be able to build out the operational capacity we
need to scale Hack Club through 2016 and beyond -- the work done in the next 6
months will be the foundation of our growth in the years to come.

Per our latest poll, the average club size is 17 members. Assuming we keep that
average number of attendees, expanding to 200 schools will bring our membership
to 3,400 high schoolers. For the vast majority of these students, Hack Club will
be their first exposure to coding.

Assuming we continue to grow by 250% each year, 21,000 students will be in Hack
Clubs by the end of 2018. By the end of 2019, we'll have 53,000. In 2020,
there'll be over 100,000.

Code changes lives. It shows students that they can build anything and be anyone
-- we truly believe it's the closest thing we have to a superpower. We hope
you'll join us at this pivotal stage to make Hack Club the entry point for high
schoolers around the world.
