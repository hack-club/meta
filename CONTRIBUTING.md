# HackEDU's Amazing Readme

## Step 1: You have issues, I have issues, we all have issues!
Every Github project has issues. Literally.

### Issues == Reddit_posts  and Issues == Facebook_posts
An issues has a topic, some content, and can be commented upon just like a post on many social networks. An issues made for a github project is typically about a bug, recommendation, or relevant discussion for the project. Issues can also have tags and can be search for. Old issues (that have been resolved or are no longer relevant) are closed, which simply means that they no longer appear when searching for open threads. They are still archived and can even be reopened if needed. If you need help anywhere in this tutorial just open up an issue and we'll get right on it. 

### Lets talk with issues
In [project name] we use issues for any discussion relevant to running a club. If you have a question, proposal, or something you want to say of general interest, just open up an issue!

## Step 2: Contribute!
When you want to add content to a repository permanently you can make a *pull request*. A pull request is a request for some edit or addition to be made to a repository. If you have a tutorial, document, or piece of media you think all hackedu members can benefit from you should definitely make a *pull request*! (or else). *Pull requests* can also be used for adding to, editing, or removing existing documents. A *pull request* won't automaticly make the change but will instead open up the change up for discussion, which we'll explain later in the [Discuss] section. 

### Edit maker
Making an edit is simple, just navigate to whatever document you want to change and click on the little pencil icon in the upper right hand corner. From there you can edit the file in Githubs native text editor to your heart's content.

Once you're done you can just turn that into a pull request by adding a small description of why you made that change and making a pull request. 

### Make an edit, right here, right now!
Now its your turn, Note that if you are on the main page of a project you won't see a little pencil icon in the upper right hand corner.  for the readme since you're not on the readme's own page, you can click on the readme in the main repository to edit it. You can also go to [this link] to go to this files actual page. Go and do that. Okay, you're on this files actual page now? Good. Now click on the pencil icon and make your edit. Correct some spelling, word choice, ambiguity, or whatever, its your choice! If you want, you can look at the [README Todo] section at the bottom of this document for edits that need to be made.


### Adding a new document
To add a new document navigate to the folder you want to add the document too, click the plus sign in the corner, and write your document.

From there make the pull request just like you would an edit. 

### Adding yourself!
Now its your turn. In this repository we have an "Introductions" folder for people to be introduced to HackEDU. If you want to find out more about somebody you can just check out their introduction in that folder. Now make your own introduction by adding a file to that folder titled with your first and last name, capitalized and separated with a space. Don't worry, this repository is invite only so only HackEDU members will be able to see it.

### Talking about Pull Requests
Active pull requests can be seen by clicking on the Pull requests icon to the right of a repository.

Comments on pull requests are for having a discussion on whether or not the edits proposed by the pull request should be done. HackEDU's leader can accept the pull requests and have them implemented. For simple pull requests they may do this right away but for larger changes they may ask some questions and discussion may be needed.


## Step 3: Advanced Stuff
There's a lot more to talk about when it comes to Github, including markdown syntax which can be used to format issues, comments, and many other documents nicely on Github, and use of the Github command line client to do more complicated pull requests. We won't talk about that here since there are plenty of online tutorials to help you with that kind of stuff.

## README Todo
- Add pictures to illustrate the tutorial
- Expand the Advanced Stuff sections with links.
- Mention how Github works with emails.
- Fix spelling, grammar, and general English mistakes
- Improve the tone/humour
- Add more to and improve the README Todo
- Fix the sixth item on the README Todo, its just a bad joke
- Change step 3 to make it more of a conclusion
- figure out readme capitalization properly
