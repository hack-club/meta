#
# This script reminds attendees of The Hack Series about the event and is meant
# to be run for each session the morning before it starts. It expects you to
# have twilio-sms (see at the bottom of this comment) in your PATH
#
# The best way to run sms-remind is to do the following:
#
# 1. Update the variables at the beginning of this script to reflect the data
#    you want to text attendees
#
# 2. Create a file with all of the session's attendees' numbers in it, one per
#    line. Example (with placeholder numbers):
#
#        Contents of /tmp/example_numbers:
#
#        415-342-2342
#        415-480-2891
#        415-322-5901
#        415-234-2342
#
# 3. Once you have that, run the following command, replacing $SMS_REMIND_PATH
#    with the path to this file:
#
#        $ cat /tmp/example_numbers | xargs -L 1 $SMS_REMIND_PATH
#
#    This runs this script once with each of the numbers in /tmp/example_numbers
#    as the first argument. If you expanded the actual commands being ran, it'd
#    look like the following:
#
#        $ $SMS_REMIND_PATH 415-342-2342
#        $ $SMS_REMIND_PATH 415-480-2891
#        $ $SMS_REMIND_PATH 415-322-5901
#        $ $SMS_REMIND_PATH 415-234-2342
#
#    And boom! All of the attendees in /tmp/example_numbers have been texted.
