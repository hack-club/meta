### 12:45 : Play Host & Facilitate Conversation

It is your job to be a great host!

- Be a good host by making every participant feel like you were welcoming them
  like the president!

  naturally not talk to each other!

  - Gives everyone a sticker

  - Offers guests water
  - Gives them a brief tour of the Make School and explains briefly what it is
3. **The Conversationalist**

    someone already there
