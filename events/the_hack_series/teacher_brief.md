Hey!

Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me on the phone earlier today
-- I'm from the nonprofit that called.

Below are the full details for the workshops we're running this weekend. I'd
really appreciate it if you could forward it to the teachers and ask them to
announce it during class. We've had the most success when they put the website
on a projector, if they have one, and print out the attached PDF to pass around
to students (I've attached a PDF) :-).

## The Hack Series, hosted by Hack Club

_Never written code before? Build your first website this weekend at The Hack
Series, a free workshop hosted in downtown San Francisco by Hack Club for
absolute beginners._

**Go here to register: https://series.hackclub.com**

**Contact email: series@hackclub.com**

**Cost: Free**

**Location: 1547 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94103**

We'll be running ten 10-15 person sessions this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
Each session lasts 2.5 hours with a 30 minute break. Spots are limited and
filling up, so if you're interested go to our website and sign up now! It's
free.

#### What will you learn?

You'll leave the workshop with two things built:

- A personal website
- A website that calls and texts your phone

We'll also be providing you with a series of workshops to do in your free time
that'll teach you the basics of game development.

#### How much do I need to know?

Zero, nil, none. We're designing the workshop for people who have never written
code before.

The less you know about coding, the better (though if you do have some
experience, we'd still love to have you!) :-).

#### Who are we?

Hack Club is a San Francisco-based nonprofit that brings coding clubs to high
school around the globe. We are in 52 schools across 12 states and 5 countries.
