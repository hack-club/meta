# Harrison Notes

## Workshops

- Students had to leave for parking space
  - Looked distracted?
  - Getaway vehicle?
  - Nope. Came back... Woo!
- Lots of repetition
- Not quite sure demo was analogous to what we really need
- I'm very tired.
- Not closing JS Bin header
- Ambiguity
- Not sure how to setup layout
  - Constantly losing their code
  - Not able to read effectively
- Some people are not comfortable with the teaching style
  - Want more specific instructions
- Chung is reading the whole thing before writing any code
  - Although discovered the code way
- We're moving *really* slow
  - One hour in, barely anyway through the content
- Ran out of content and did not know what to do
- Classes were not clear

## Demos

- Needs a better bad example
- Good job at doing good example
- Jonathan should fix his hackEDU on his site
- People did not seem quite sure how to present/ what they were required to do
  - Perhaps it would be better to *only* show a good example of a demo
    - Stop confusion

## Extra

- We need more demos
-
