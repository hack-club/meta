# Hiring

This directory contains Hack Club's documents on hiring. Also check out the [hiring protocol](../processes/hiring_protocol.md).

## What type of people do we want to hire?

We only want to hire people that are examples of what we want our community members to be in the future.

How do you figure out what we want our community members to be in the future? Think about potential candidates for a position, ask if they qualify as examples, and if not, figure out why.

Here are some questions that immediately come to mind for potential candidates:

- Are they technical? How did they learn to code? Are they primarily self taught?
- Is coding a day job? Do they build things for fun?
- Are they regularly building projects outside of work? What do those projects look like?
- Are they a hacker? What sorts of systems have they broken? What hacks are they most proud of?
- Do they build things for others? Are they involved in any open source communities? How about physical communities (like meetups)?
- Are they still learning? What sorts of learning are they doing today? Do they care about issues outside of programming?
- Are they opinionated? How do they act in arguments? Are they afraid to think against the grain? When have they done that?
- How do they hack their life? Do they care about improving their workflow or daily systems? Do they program their tools (ex. make plugins for their editor, make lots of customizations to their computer)?
- Why do they care about coding? Is it about building the next hit app? Is it about making a lot of money in a job? Is it about creating art?
